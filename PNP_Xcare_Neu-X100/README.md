# Introduction 

**About this document**

This document describes how to connect [Nexaiot Neu-X100]( https://www.nexcom.com.tw/Products/multi-media-solutions/fanless-edge-computing-system/neu-x-atom/ai-edge-computer-neu-x100) to Azure IoT Hub using the Azure IoT Explorer with certified device application and device models.

IoT Plug and Play certified device simplifies the process of building devices without custom device code. Using Solution builders can integrated quickly using the certified IoT Plug and Play enabled device based on Azure IoT Central as well as third-party solutions.

This getting started guide provides step by step instruction on getting the device provisioned to Azure IoT Hub using Device Provisioning Service (DPS) and using Azure IoT Explorer to interact with device's capabilities.

[Nexaiot Neu-X100]( https://www.nexcom.com.tw/Products/multi-media-solutions/fanless-edge-computing-system/neu-x-atom/ai-edge-computer-neu-x100) is Powered by IntelÂ® Apollo Lake processor, the Neu-X100 fanless embedded player can handle 2 independence display output. The Neu-X100 supports HDMI display, USB 3.0 ports, and a RS232/RS422/RS485 interface, is an ideal embedded player to optimize information visualization, convey brand messages, customer engagement, and smart retail management efficiencies to increase in-store traffic and sales. Also could be applicate as gateway for smart city. The slim fanless design with extended durability further covers usages like endless aisles, QSRs, drive-thru kiosks, bus stops, digital transit information signs, and information stands.

# Step 3: Prepare your DPS and iot hub

-   Connect to the Azure portal and Create [Azure IOT Hub Device Provisioning Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-dps/quick-setup-auto-provision) and [Azure IoT Hub Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/about-iot-hub)
-   Please keep the DPS information (ID Scope/Global device endpoint/Device Key).
-   Please Create a device under [Azure IoT Hub Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/about-iot-hub) and keep the device ID.

# Step 4: Build and Run the sample

-   Download the [Xcare SDK](https://github.com/allanchen1971/AzureCertification/tree/master/PNP_Xcare_Neu-X100) and the sample programs and save them to your local repository.
-   Start a new instance of Visual Studio 2019.
-   Open the **xcarePNP.csproj** solution in your local copy of the repository.
-   In **Solution Explorer**, right-click and choose **Build** for build this project.
-   right-click the **XcarePNP** project, click **Debug**, and then add run parameter : "-s dps -i {DPS ID Scope} -d {Device ID} -k {DeviceKey} -e {Global device endpoint}"
-   click **Start new instance** to build and run the sample. The console displays messages as the application sends device-to-cloud messages to IoT Hub.

# Integration with Azure IoT Explorer

-   Use the **DeviceExplorer** utility and Click **IoT Plug and Play components**
-   (Step1) On the **Model ID** field to fill **dtmi:nexcom:NEUX100;1**
-   (Step2) You can add **Public Repositiory** or Choose **Local Folder** (Path on Models in your local copy of the repository.
-   (Step3) Click **Components"->**Default component**
-   Refer [IOT Plug and Play components]( https://github.com/allanchen1971/AzureCertification/tree/master/PNP_Xcare_Neu-X100/Picture/PNP1.jpg)
-   You can see the device **Information\Properties(read-only)\Properties(writable)\Commands\Telemetry**
-   Refer [IOT Plug and Play components Interface]( https://github.com/allanchen1971/AzureCertification/tree/master/PNP_Xcare_Neu-X100/Picture/PNP2.jpg)to see the your device Interface.
-   Refer [IOT Plug and Play components Properiteies]( https://github.com/allanchen1971/AzureCertification/tree/master/PNP_Xcare_Neu-X100/Picture/PNP3.jpg)to see the your device Properitieies.
-   Refer [IOT Plug and Play components Properiteies (writable)]( https://github.com/allanchen1971/AzureCertification/tree/master/PNP_Xcare_Neu-X100/Picture/PNP4.jpg)to see the your device Properitieies(writable).
-   Refer [IOT Plug and Play components Command]( https://github.com/allanchen1971/AzureCertification/tree/master/PNP_Xcare_Neu-X100/Picture/pnp5.jpg)to sent your reboot command.
-   Under **Telemetry** property and press **Start** to observe the messages IoT Hub receives from the application.
